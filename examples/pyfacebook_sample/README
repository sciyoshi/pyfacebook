This is a sample Django application for PyFacebook.

To use this application, copy the entire folder to an existing
Django application. Then you need to edit the following settings:

* In settings.py, make sure that TEMPLATE_LOADERS contains
  'django.template.loaders.app_directories.load_template_source'. This
  is so that templates can be loaded from this template directory.

* In settings.py, define FACEBOOK_API_KEY and FACEBOOK_SECRET_KEY to your
  own values.

* In settings.py, add the following line to the variable MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES:
  'facebook.djangofb.FacebookMiddleware'. This will attach a facebook object
  to every incoming request.

* In urls.py, have something in your urlpatterns like:
  (r'^facebook/', include('YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.pyfacebook_sample.urls')),
  This will tell the sample application to live under /facebook/.

* On the Facebook applications page, make sure that you set your callback
  to the appropriate URL. In this example, it would be
  'http://YOUR_IP/facebook/canvas/', and DON'T FORGET THE TRAILING SLASH :-)

* Change any occurrences of pyfacebook to your own application name.

That should be about it...
